IAI-IPS Symbolic Cognition System



Overview

The IAI-IPS Symbolic Cognition System bridges human and computer cognition using quantum entanglement within UBCI and SynapseLink, enabling declarative symbolic control over quantum-neural interfaces.

Features

✅ Declarative symbolic language for quantum-neural symbiosis
✅ Quantum state and entanglement management
✅ Twine Cognition Engine for multi-modal learning modes
✅ CI pipeline with automated benchmarking, reports, and lab notifications
✅ Badge above reflects live system status

Quickstart

git clone https://github.com/YourUserOrOrg/YourRepoName.git
