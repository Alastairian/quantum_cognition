IAI-IPS Symbolic Cognition System

Overview

The IAI-IPS Symbolic Cognition System bridges human and computer cognition using quantum entanglement principles within UBCI and SynapseLink frameworks. It leverages a dialectical symbolic system aligned with Logos (analytical cognition) and Pathos (intuitive cognition) to model, interpret, and execute declarative symbolic statements that manage quantum and neural information transfer.

Features

✅ Declarative symbolic language for entanglement-based cognitive programming.
✅ Quantum state management (entanglement, coherence, measurement).
✅ Neural pattern simulation (activation, attention patterns).
✅ Twine Cognition Engine managing learning modes and Logos ↔ Pathos feedback.
✅ Layered dialectical symbol system (opposing aspects, contradictions).
✅ Ready for extension to quantum hardware and BCI input pipelines.

Repository Structure

iai_ips_symbolic_system.py: Main interpreter skeleton.

/docs: Contains architecture diagrams and LaTeX publication files.

tests/: Includes structured test cases for symbol parsing and execution.

data/: Prepared symbolic datasets for validation and benchmarking.


Example Usage

from iai_ips_symbolic_system import execute_statement, TwineCognitionManager

context = {'twine': TwineCognitionManager()}
statements = [
    "DECLARE QuantumNeuralLink QNL1",
    "DECLARE QuantumNeuralLink QNL2",
    "ENTANGLE QNL1 QNL2",
    "MEASURE QNL1",
    "ACTIVATE attention_pattern",
    "SWITCHMODE P",
    "CHECKFIDELITY QNL1 0.8"
]

for stmt in statements:
    execute_statement(stmt, context)

Symbol Table (Core)

Symbol	Meaning

PSI_C	Maintain coherence; triggers error correction.
PSI_D	Allow decoherence; enables measurement.
NABLA_I	Internal contradiction marker.
L_ERROR	Logos error signal.
M_UNEASE	Pathos unease signal.
M_CONFIDENCE	Pathos confirmation signal.
D, G, H, P	Learning modes (Deeper, Generalized, Historical, Predictive).


Testing

Run structured symbolic datasets from the tests/ folder:

python tests/test_symbolic_execution.py

Roadmap

[ ] Integrate Qiskit/Cirq backends for live quantum operations.

[ ] Add BCI input pipeline (EEG signal translation to symbolic triggers).

[ ] Consciousness-level abstraction blocks for high-order cognitive task programming.

[ ] Symbolic-to-visual interpreter to track Twine cognition feedback in real-time.
